# BREAST-CANCER-PREDICTION
 CURATORS UNIVERSITY(COVEN WORKS PROJECT(INTERMEDIATE BOOTCAMP))
This algorithm written in Python classifies a breast cancer condition into either Benign or Malignant.
The code is well commented which hence implies easy understanding.
An accuracy of 95 percent was obtained from the lOGISTIC REGRESSION Model
The code was originally written in Notebook but trasferred to Spyder incase those who dont use notebook.
