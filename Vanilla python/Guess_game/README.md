# Guessing_Game
This code should be run on the commandline only

This code accepts your guess and tells you if it is correct or not,you keep guessing until you can probably guess the correct number
or till you give up.

When you are tired type the word *exit*. This will exit the game.

When you give up,type the word *giveup*. This will exit the game also and provide a summary statistics of your predictions and the number of times you have guessed.

Enjoy

Feel free to use the code in developing a GUI / Game or any other applications but ensure you reference/cite this repo. Thanks!
