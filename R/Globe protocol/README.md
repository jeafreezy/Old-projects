# GLOBE-PROTOCOL-PROJECT
This short code solved just the problem at hand!And made our work a lot easier.
This R code visualizes the correlation between some observed physico-chemical water parameters.
The #newmay and #newoct are the concerned parameter with high relevance on the course.They are both subsetted from the Ilara Wetland May and Ilara  Wetland Oct dataset.
The dataset are physico-chemical water parameter acquired from the field.
The pairplot output shed more light on the cause of waterborne disease in the study area and the correlation between the parameters.
An increase/decrease in one leads to an increase/decrease in another.
